( pip install flask ) \r\n\r\nThis allows you to read your digital comic collection in a web browser on any device. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn its current state it will take a folder of comics ( CBZ and CBR only right now ) and will allow a user to browse through all subdirectories and select comics.\r\n\r\nOnce selected the comic is copied to a static folder, unpacked, embedded into some html and displayed. Each comic is served up from a unique folder.\r\n\r\nCurrently you will want to clean out the unique folders generated in the static folder every once an a while. It does not have a janitor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## VERSION HISTORY:\r\n\r\n**v0.1a** \r\n* Core Functionality, and some html styling. IT FUCKING WORKS!!\r\n\r\n**v0.2a**\r\n* Added Loading screen for unpacking comics\r\n\r\n**v0.3b**\r\n* Added Some basic application logging (incomplete)\r\n* Added auto scroll to top on Comic Load and Entering a new directory\r\n* Added support for GIF and PNG\r\n* Corrected Logo and Loading to not rely on external address\r\n* Added info div and link\r\n* Added better error handling for running in production \r\n\r\n\r\n## HELP:\r\n\r\nFeel free to send me a message! I will be glad to explain my work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
